# Building-a-Web-App-with-ASP.NET-Core
Building a Web App with ASP.NET Core, MVC, Entity Framework Core, Bootstrap, and Angular

In this project, I built a website from scratch using the latest version of Microsoft's ASP.NET Core 2.0 framework. 
I explore technologies inside of ASP.NET Core like Entity Framework, using ASP.NET Identity, building APIs with ASP.NET MVC, 
and deploying the app to the server or the cloud. 
In addition, I built an Angular 6 application to explore how to mix server and client-side development in ASP.NET Core.
